## SAMOA Fork for Sentinel Project
This is a fork of open-source project ```SAMOA``` for Sentinel.
 
## Getting Started 

*   Clone this repository 
*   Clone Sentinel --- ```git clone https://github.com/ambodi/sentinel```
*   Put Sentinel under ```samoa-api/src/main/java/com/yahoo/labs/samoa/sentinel```
*   Add your ```twitter4j.properties``` file in the root of the project. More info at [Twitter 4J's Documentation on Generic properties](http://twitter4j.org/en/configuration.html "Title")
*   Run ```mvn clean package```
*   To Debug or Run 
    ```-X exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.yahoo.labs.samoa.app``` 
    Or 
    ```bin/samoa local target/SAMOA-Local-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar   "com.yahoo.labs.samoa.sentinel.task.SentimentAnalysis -p 4 -i 100"```

SAMOA: Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis.
=================
SAMOA is a platform for mining on big data streams.
It is a distributed streaming machine learning (ML) framework that contains a 
programing abstraction for distributed streaming ML algorithms.

SAMOA enables development of new ML algorithms without dealing with 
the complexity of underlying streaming processing engines (SPE, such 
as Apache Storm and Apache S4). SAMOA also provides extensibility in integrating
new SPEs into the framework. These features allow SAMOA users to develop 
distributed streaming ML algorithms once and to execute the algorithms 
in multiple SPEs, i.e., code the algorithms once and execute them in multiple SPEs.

## Build

###Storm mode

Simply clone the repository and install SAMOA.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:yahoo/samoa.git
cd samoa
mvn -Pstorm package
```

The deployable jar for SAMOA will be in `target/SAMOA-Storm-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

###S4 mode

If you want to compile SAMOA for S4, you will need to install the S4 dependencies
manually as explained in [Executing SAMOA with Apache S4](../../wiki/Executing-SAMOA-with-Apache-S4).

Once the dependencies if needed are installed, you can simply clone the repository and install SAMOA.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yahoo/samoa.git
cd samoa
mvn -Ps4 package
```

###Local mode

If you want to test SAMOA in a local environment, simply clone the repository and install SAMOA.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yahoo/samoa.git
cd samoa
mvn package
```

The deployable jar for SAMOA will be in `target/SAMOA-Local-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

## Documentation

The documentation is intended to give an introduction on how to use SAMOA in the various different ways possible. 
As a user you can use it to develop new algorithms and test different Stream Processing Engines.
